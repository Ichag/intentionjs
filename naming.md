# Naming the new Dow Jones Open Source Initiative
- NYtimes has "Open" … so thats a no-go

## Narrowed down
- DJ Commons
- DJ Reach
- DJ Source
- DJ Link
- DJ Branch

- DJ Open Ops lol DJ Oops, **DJ Ops** (Open Source, Opportunities, Operation), Oh yeah, "Open" is taken…
- **DJ Open-Door**
- DJ Projects, DJ Open Projects, DJ Creations, 
- DJ Collaboration, DJ Collab Labs, DJ Collabs (DJ ColLabs)
	- **I like where this one is going…** 
- DJ Blueprint
- **DJ Commons**, DJ Community, DJ Communal, DJ Popular, DJ Publics (maybe not so similar to Publix: just Public), DJ General, **DJ Join**, 
- DJ Reach (outreach, inreach, growth),
- DJ Circles (like what goes around comes around)… sounds like Google Circles :s, DJ Cycles, DJ Systems, DJ Orbit, DJ Rotations, DJ Orbits, DJ Circulation (NEWS)

## Broader ideas
- Seems like we're limited to beginning with "DJ"
- Concatenating "open source" into something… DJ Open, **DJ Source**, DJ OpenSrc, 
- Why does it have to be *named* open source.. How explicit do we have to be here? Oh wait, that's exactly what you want. Well, sort of. I want it to be super explicit and digestible, but that doesn't make it antithetical to being pretty. What's both pretty and simple? 
- Pulling from some type of geeky code thing: DJ Branch
- DJ NAMES! DJ SHADOW, DJ KHALED
- Synonyms for open: 
- Synonyms for commons: DJ Community
- Play on DJ as Did-Ja **OMG** this is the worst idea ever 
- Look at the history of open source and use some of the describing ethos/methods as names: DJ Maddog, DJ Redistribution, 
- Inclusion: DJ Community, DJ Good Community, Dow Jones Inclusive Projects (DJ Inclusive Projects), DJ Public, DJ Project Public, 
- "*access to un-obfuscated source code*" DJ Access, *DJ UNLOCKED* , 
- GitHub stuff: DJ Branch, DJ Repo, DJ Merge, DJ Contributions, DJ Contribute, DJ Branch
- **I don't like the idea of a name that makes it sound like "we're inviting you". I like, instead, "we're joining you"**


## Ok let's think about why we're actually doing this
- First off, let's not pretend we're doing the ultimate reason *isn't* money. That said, there are genuinely good things to contributing to open-source.
- We're trying to attract young developer talent
- We're trying to get people using our products
- We're trying to stay on top of new technologies, trying to maintain an innovative web presence
- My goals I'm projecting onto the company: unpretentiousness, transparency, accessibility, normal-speak, making this company actually do something good :), injecting a bit of humor into a stuffy code environment, easily digestible content, **rethinking how projects have to work and how information has to be presented**, rethinking the tropes of jQuery plugin sites, rethinking documentation, rethinking navigation, **rethinking EVERYTHING**, having a company engage with a community, having a company *contribute* to a community
- Open source is such a cool distribution model that feels totally natural. Sometimes it seems like open source can only exist so long as other (worse) models are the commonality. Open source kind of has to be the subversive alternative. But it's cool that it can be injected into a notoriously closed environment (news)
- The group works better, more is different
- What types of things represent the ethos this initiative is putting forth?
- Why would a news company invest in innovating web technologies? What is the explicit connection between news and technology? Is it that news companies are now faced with the last-minute challenge of adapting to new technologies? Is it that news companies are quickly being replaced by the amateurization of information, and therefore need to use the same technologies to form a sort of legitimacy? 
- Why does the term open source have to mean plain and white layouts?

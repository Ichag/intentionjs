## Scattered thoughts and ideas
- DJ Write (you know, like writing code but also writing news)
	- let's look up some synonyms
- DJ Nodes (a part of something bigger)
	- *this is decent*
- DJ Step, DJ Path, DJ Ladder
- DJ Works, Werk, 
- DJ Open Ops lol DJ Oops, DJ Ops (Open Source, Opportunities, Operation), Oh yeah, "Open" is taken…
- **DJ Open-Door** **DJ Open-ended**
- DJ Transparency
- DJ Projects, DJ Open Projects, -DJ Creations-
- DJ Collaboration, DJ Collab Labs, DJ Collabs (DJ ColLabs)
	- **I like where this one is going…** 
- DJ Blueprint
- **DJ Commons**, DJ Community, DJ Communal, DJ Popular, DJ Publics (maybe not so similar to Publix: just Public), DJ General, DJ Join, **DJ Assembly**
- DJ Reach (outreach, inreach, growth),
- DJ Circles (like what goes around comes around)… sounds like Google Circles :s, DJ Cycles, DJ Systems, DJ Orbit, DJ Rotations, DJ Orbits, DJ Circulation (NEWS)

## Broader ideas
- Seems like we're limited to beginning with "DJ"
- Concatenating "open source" into something… DJ Open, **DJ Source**, DJ OpenSrc, 
- Why does it have to be *named* open source.. How explicit do we have to be here? Oh wait, that's exactly what you want. Well, sort of. I want it to be super explicit and digestible, but that doesn't make it antithetical to being pretty. What's both pretty and simple? 
- Pulling from some type of geeky code thing: DJ Branch
- DJ NAMES! DJ SHADOW, DJ KHALED
- Synonyms for open: 
- Synonyms for commons: DJ Community
- Play on DJ as Did-Ja **OMG** this is the worst idea ever 
- Look at the history of open source and use some of the describing ethos/methods as names: DJ Maddog, DJ Redistribution, 
- Inclusion: DJ Community, DJ Good Community, Dow Jones Inclusive Projects (DJ Inclusive Projects), DJ Public, DJ Project Public, 
- "*access to un-obfuscated source code*"
	- DJ Access, DJ UNLOCKED
- GitHub stuff: DJ Branch, DJ Repo, DJ Merge, DJ Contributions, DJ Contribute
- **I don't like the idea of a name that makes it sound like "we're inviting you". I like, instead, "we're joining you"**


## Ok let's think about why we're actually doing this
- First off, let's not pretend we're doing the ultimate reason *isn't* money. That said, there are genuinely good things to contributing to open-source.
- We're trying to attract young developer talent
- We're trying to get people using our products
- We're trying to stay on top of new technologies, trying to maintain an innovative web presence
- My goals I'm projecting onto the company: unpretentiousness, transparency, accessibility, normal-speak, making this company actually do something good :), **injecting a bit of humor into a stuffy code environment**, easily digestible content, **rethinking how projects have to work and how information has to be presented**, rethinking the tropes of jQuery plugin sites, rethinking documentation, rethinking navigation, **rethinking EVERYTHING**, having a company engage with a community, having a company *contribute* to a community
- Open source is such a cool distribution model that feels totally natural. Sometimes it seems like open source can only exist so long as other (worse) models are the commonality. Open source kind of has to be the subversive alternative. But it's cool that it can be injected into a notoriously closed environment (news)
- The group works better, more is different
- What types of things represent the ethos this initiative is putting forth?
- Why would a news company invest in innovating web technologies? What is the explicit connection between news and technology? Is it that news companies are now faced with the last-minute challenge of adapting to new technologies? Is it that news companies are quickly being replaced by the amateurization of information, and therefore need to use the same technologies to form a sort of legitimacy? 
- Why does the term open source have to mean plain and white layouts?

## According to our open source ethics, this should be super explicit
- DJ Projects

## On the Origin of "Origin"
- My concern with these kind of names is that it sound alike we're trying to be "origin" of open source, or we want to be taken as the point from which all open source comes. I'm not into this. It sounds pretentious, and open source has existed for a while. We're just late to the party.
- The open source initiative is not innovative. It's the *projects* that should be innovative. 
- On the contrary, the origin would refer to the point from which all of *our* open source projects start. They all exist because we have made this initiative for ourselves. It's not that we're the origin of *all* open source projects, but that we are the origin of *our* open source projects.
- Overall I think it connotes bad things.

## Being Funny
Jay's right, I think, in that our best bet might be to do something "funny" . We're kind of late to the party, we're not exactly innovating in just creating this initiative, but we can innovate within it. 

- DJ TAL (dee jay tall, digital)
	- "technically a little late"
	- "Transparency and Libre"
- Let's just name it DJ Open Source but 
- DJ HAL, DJ 9000
- DJ Outset, DJ (out)Set, DJ Set, **DJ Setlist** 
	- **IT'S *GOTTA* BE DJ SETLIST**
- **DJ Open Ended**, DJ Open Plan (lol horizontal)
- DJ Horizontal (this is a bad joke only I would laugh at)
- DJ Synth (like a synthesizer… like things we synthesize… oh god…) 
- DJ Libre!
- DJ B.E.E.R. (where the acronym describes free as in liberating)
- DJ e-tiquette (e-etiquette)
- 

## We could play off of words for the Internet
After all, we are kind of thinking about a community of people working across (institutional) borders, just like the internet. Not to mention these will all be web technologies.
- DJ Web  — if we had an acronym it could work, but on it's own it's not very creative. Like, *I get it*, it's about a web of people and a web of networks, but come *on*.
	- Work Extends Institutional Borders
	- Wide Extensive -Bureaucracy- Blueprints
	- Widely Extending Blueprints
	- Working to Expand Institutional Boundaries (omg NO this isn't about empires
	- Working to ELIMINATE institutional Boundaries (too… protest-y)

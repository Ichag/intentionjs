   <h2 alt="Overview">What It's all About</h2>
   <p>Intention.js is a lightweight tool for responsive design developed at <a href="https://github.com/dowjones">Dow Jones</a> that manipulates the DOM via HTML attributes. The methods for manipulation are placed with the elements themselves, so flexible layouts don't seem so abstract and messy.</p>
   <p>What should the classes of an element be on mobile vs tablet? Where should your advertising code get placed when you're on a desktop? Does the page require an alternate slideshow widget on touch enabled devices? These are all changes that Intention.js can make to the page based on a user's device. Context.js creates a set of common page contexts for width thresholds, touch devices, highres displays and a fallback.</p>
   <p><i>And</i> you can easily add your own contexts on top of these or create all your own custom threshold group.</p>

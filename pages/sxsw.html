							<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p>What to Expect
The strategy of responsive design has long since been accepted as the way to deal with creating web sites that appear custom-tailored to any and every device. Media queries, responsive image strategies and modern semantics have led to the rapid adoption of the ideals of dealing with every possibility simultaneously. What isn't readily apparent about this method of web development though is that the hierarchy of content often suffers as a result of the one-size-adapts-to-all strategy.

<h6>
"Intentional design builds upon where responsive design left off"
</h6>
<p>
Intentional design builds upon where responsive design left off, offering clear ways of creating dynamically restructured html using a light-weight library and authoring strategy, thereby increasing the layout options and flexibility, reducing development time and lessening the necessity of media-query-driven stylesheet overrides. Determined by a device type / input method matrix, a more accurate context is used to create a backwards-compatible, scalable, flexible front-end.
</p>


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The purpose of this talk is to discuss the limitations of current design philosophies and implementation strategies for multi-device-targeted products. Ideally, attendees will be in either a strategic role, defining multi-platform product development roadmaps. Alternatively, an attendee would be one who has a significant knowledge of html, css and javascript, with the intention of learning how implementations of responsive design on a large scale.</p>
<br>


<h3>What to Bring</h3>
<p>Note-taking devices are always welcome and relevant. Code will be distributed via github.

In 2008, Sparling was asked to create a curriculum to educate designers in using the web as an artistic medium, for Cooper Union. Since then, he has taught a series of three classes on the fundamentals of html, css and programming, interactive design concepts, and interactive-graphic-focused api hacking.
Since 2004, Sparling's illustration work has been featured in the New York Times, Heeb Magazine and the Baltimore City Paper, as well as having work in Print Magazine and The Royal Society of Mathematics and Science. Sparlingâ€™s illustrations have also been featured on the cover of Siggraph's Computer Graphics Magazine, and the subject of a workflow case study on adobe.com.

Intention
	DOM Manipulation based on a html attribute specifications

	Three manipulation types: class, attribute, placement (move)

	An algo to determine the best match in a set of attributes is used for single value attributes

	in the case of classes (multi-value attribute) a combination algo is used. simple union




Context
	Reports information about the browser window when the dimension crosses a user defined threshold

	information reported is: 
		threshold value (number in pixels)
		name of threshold (allows for easy integration with intention framework)
		pixel density
		interaction mode (mouse or touch)

	The purpose of this software is to constantly incorporate new interaction modes and the transition between them
		i.e. Device A transitions from touch interaction mode -> mouse interaction via a mouseDeviceDetected event (imaginary js event)

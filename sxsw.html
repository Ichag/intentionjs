				<h3>What to Expect</h3>
		<p>
		The strategy of responsive design has long since been accepted as the way to deal with creating web sites that appear custom-tailored to any and every device. Media queries, responsive image strategies and modern semantics have led to the rapid adoption of the ideals of dealing with every possibility simultaneously. What isn't readily apparent about this method of web development though is that the hierarchy of content often suffers as a result of the one-size-adapts-to-all strategy.
		</p>


		<h6>
		"Intentional design builds upon where responsive design left off"
		</h6>
		
		<p>
		Intentional design builds upon where responsive design left off, offering clear ways of creating dynamically restructured html using a light-weight library and authoring strategy, thereby increasing the layout options and flexibility, reducing development time and lessening the necessity of media-query-driven stylesheet overrides. Determined by a device type / input method matrix, a more accurate context is used to create a backwards-compatible, scalable, flexible front-end.
		</p>


		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
		<p>The purpose of this talk is to discuss the limitations of current design philosophies and implementation strategies for multi-device-targeted products. Ideally, attendees will be in either a strategic role, defining multi-platform product development roadmaps. Alternatively, an attendee would be one who has a significant knowledge of html, css and javascript, with the intention of learning how implementations of responsive design on a large scale.</p>
		<br>


		<h3>What to Bring</h3>
		<p>Note-taking devices are always welcome and relevant. Code will be distributed via github.
